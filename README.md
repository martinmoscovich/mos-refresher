#mos-refresher

Pull to Refresh component for the Ionic Framework

### Description

This component allows you to add a customizable "Pull to Refresh" to an Ionic application.
The behavior and looks can be customized using just HTML/CSS (for simple cases) or, when needed, the Javascript API.

It comes with a few out-of-the-box options in case you prefer to add it without coding.
